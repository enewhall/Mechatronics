<h2>Functional Architecture</h2>
Information containing part location and orientation must be continually determined and<br>
transmitted continually.  A part leaves the separator and arrives at the camera in one of<br>
four possible orientations.  Vision processing determine both when the part has arrived <br>
and it’s orientation.  When the part arrives the part separator must be told to stop while<br>
the part is being handled.   Also, the part placer must receive part orientation from <br>
vision processing in order to move the part correctly.  The part placer must command the <br>
tray positioner into the proper position since the part placer only has freedom to move in<br>
the x axis and the tray can only move in the y axis.  Once the part is in place the part<br>
placer notifies the flux and wire dispenser that the part is available.  The flux and <br>
wire dispenser also can only move along the x axis so it too must command the tray <br>
positioner<br>

<h2>Cyberphysical Architecture</h2>
The primary controller for the pretinning machine is the Arduino Microprocessor which <br>
responsible for interpreting all feedback from sensors and sending all commands to motors<br>
 and other physical devices.  The Raspberry Pi Microcomputer is dedicated entirely to <br>
image processing for the camera.  The Raspberry Pi sends information about part location <br>
and orientation which is derived from image processing back to the Arduino so that correct<br>
movements can be made.<br>

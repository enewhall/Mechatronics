<h2>Part Placer Design</h2>
This subsystem is responsible for correctly orienting the parts and placing the parts into<br>
the tray. This subsystem only moves in the X direction and picks up the parts by inducing<br>
electromagnetism, but must deal with most of the complexities in this project. One such<br>
complexity is orientating the part itself given the information from the camera. <br>
If the part is not upside down, then the orientator can quickly fix the part by picking it<br>
up and rotating 180 degrees. If the part is upside down, the subsystem will attempt to <br>
flip the part over by grabbing it and inserting it into a horizontal U-shaped conveyor<br>
belt so the part comes right side up. In addition, this system strongly relies on the use<br>
of software accuracy and programming to decide upon which of these actions should it <br>
take. Another complexity it introduces, as shown before, is the tuning of its <br>
electromagnetic strength in order to prevent it from being stuck to the surface or picking<br>
up the tray. This subsystem is an arm attached to a railing that is operated with a servo <br>
for rotation, linear actuator of X position movement, and an electromagnetic material for<br>
placing and picking. <br>

<h2>Flux and Wire Dispensor Design</h2>
The purpose of this subsystem is to apply a dab of flux and two pieces of wire to the <br>
surface of each saw tip. The subsystem is mounted on a linear bearing platform, allowing <br>
it to move in the x direction so that it may reach each saw tip after they have been laid<br>
 down. A precise amount of flux is dispensed by a linear actuator pushing on the rear of <br>
the flux container, pushing the flux through a plastic tube and out of an applicator tip<br>
 that will be positioned directly above the surface of each saw tip.  This linear actuator<br>
 will be powered by a stepper motor with a threaded rod attached to its shaft, allowing <br>
for complete control of how far the actuator moves while also providing a significant<br>
 amount of force to overcome the high viscosity of the flux [1]. A spool of wire will also<br>
 be mounted to this subsystem. A motor will control the unspooling of the wire, feeding <br>
the wire into a channel in which it will be cut. The cut pieces will then be pushed out of<br>
 the channel which will be positioned such that the pieces come to lay on top of the dab<br>
 of flux on the saw tip. The wire will be cut by a modified pair of wire cutters that are <br>
actuated by a solenoid attached to one of the handles. By having the wire contained in a <br>
channel while it is being cut, we eliminate the possibility of the cut piece flying away <br>
in an unwanted direction from the shear forces exerted on it. This subsystem is the final <br>
subsystem that will interact with the saw tips in pre-tinning process, completing their <br>
preparation to be tinned.<br>

<h2>Part Seperator Design</h2>
The Part Separator is responsible for isolating individual parts from the set of 20 poured<br>
into the hopper. There is a sorting hole at the bottom of the hopper where individual <br>
parts will fall through. The hole is shaped such that parts will fall through in one of <br>
four orientations. In order for the parts to align correctly we will apply continuous <br>
agitation to the hopper. We plan on applying a vertical agitation to the hopper using a <br>
sinusoidal. We also plan on applying a horizontal agitation using a motor-powered rack<br>
and pinion. Once parts fall through the hole they will be dropped onto a conveyor belt.<br>
The conveyor belt will be about the width of the parts that fall through the hole and the<br>
conveyor belt will have walls along the sides so that the parts will not deviate from the<br>
orientation in the stage before. The hopper will continue to be agitated as the rest of <br>
the machine functions and enough room will be allocated as parts fall through the sorting <br>
hole to be put into a queue for the next process of the design. The parts move along the <br>
conveyor belt and once an individual part falls off the conveyor belt, the conveyor belt <br>
will momentarily stop as the part orientation stage deals with the part that just fell off<br>
the conveyor belt. Once the vision processing stage deals with the individual part, the <br>
conveyor belt will run again until the next part falls over.<br>

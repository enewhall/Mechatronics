<h2>Overview</h2>
Kennametal is an American supplier of tooling and industrial materials that has a<br>
plant in Victoria, British Columbia, Canada that manufactures saw tips and prepares<br>
them for attachment to a handle through a process known as pre-tinning. In this process<br>
a dab of flux is applied to the surface of a carbide saw tip and then two silver wires <br>
are carefully placed in the flux, oriented along the major diagonal of the saw tip. Once <br>
this process is complete, tinning can occur, in which the wires melt onto the saw tip in <br>
an oven.<br>
<br>
The process of pre-tinning saw tips is laborious and meticulous because of the size of <br>
the saw tips and wires that are handled. This work also can have negative health effects<br>
as the repetitive motion can cause strain injuries. Our objective is to design and build <br>
a mechatronic system capable of pre-tinning saw tips, removing the need for this task to <br>
be accomplished manually. In doing so the potential for worker injury will be greatly <br>
reduced, the small wires can be placed with greater accuracy, and there is the potential <br>
that the machine may be able to perform the task significantly faster than a worker.

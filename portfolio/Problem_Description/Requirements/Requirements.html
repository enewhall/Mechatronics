<h2>Explicit Design Requirements:</h2>
<ul>
<li>20 parts must be processed in <=5 minutes</li>
<li>Flux dab must be centered on the part-top centroid and cover 1/4 to 1/3 of the part-top’s<br>
    surface area</li>
<li>Must be able to handle at least two different part sizes</li>
<li>Machine fits within 2’x2’x2’</li>
<li>The two wires must be placed side by side in the flux dab such that: 
	<ol>
		<li>Their orientation is along the major diagonal to w/in 5°;</li>
		<li>There is no space between them laterally;</li>
		<li>Their longitudinal misalignment is <=10%</li>
	</ol>
</li>
<li>The parts will be deposited on a flat output tray in 4 rows of 5 parts each, with the<br>
    part-tops facing up. Part edges should be at least 1/2” away from the tray edge, and <br>
    there should be at least 1/4” spacing between the edges of adjacent parts.</li>
<li>No more than 5% of wires detached or wrongly positioned</li>
</ul>
<h2>Implied Design Requirements:</h2>
<ul>
<li>Machine is durable enough such that it can endure a harsh factory environment</li>
<li>The machine will have a robust design to accommodate any changes or additional <br>
    requirements of the pre-tinning process</li>
<li>Design is simple enough such that the basics of the machine will be understood by an <br>
    assembly worker</li>
<li>Design will allow easy access for a worker to fix the machine in the event of failure</li>
<li>Designed such that if a local failure occurs within the machine the remaining <br>
    functions of the machine will not be compromised </li>
</ul>

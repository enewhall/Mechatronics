<h2>Part Separator Implementation</h2>
Our part seperator consists of two main components; the hopper and the part re-orientator. Unfortunately, these two systems have not been built as of April 3rd and thus, cannot be represented with photographs. Th part hopper system will consist of a bin make of laser cut acrylic. At the bottom of this bin will be two spinning disks covered in foam. These spinning disks will rotate in unison as they are actuated by the same DC motor and will pull parts out of the hopper at a controlled rate. Once each part exits the hopper it enter the part re-orientator system. In this system each part will slide down channel at the end of which is a conveyer belt to move the part in front of our camera. If the part is in one of the four desired rotation as it exits the hopper the part will slide down the channel unobstructed all the way to the conveyor belt. However, if the part is not in one of the four desired orientations, it will make contact with and stop at our re-orientor. This re-orientor will push one edge of the part back up the channel, causing the part to rotate 90 degrees in the process. The re-orientor will then swing back, pushing the now correctly oriented part back into the corner of the channel so that it may freely slide down to the conveyor belt. This is what we envision for our part separator system but some adjustments may be made as prototyping continues.

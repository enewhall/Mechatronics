Design</a> <br><br>
The Part Placer system is a platform that is attached to two of the four rails on the top of the frame.<br>
The platform mount consists of mostly laser cut acrylic stand with machined aluminum that is made to hold<br>
on to the rails. On top of the stand, there are two aluminum brackets facing the end of the rails.<br>
On one end of the frame, there is a stepper motor hooked up with a spinning cylinder on an aluminum<br>
bracker. On the other end, there is only a spinning cylinder hooked to an aluminum bracket. A timing <br>
belt is hooked up from one aluminum bracket in the stand to the stepper motor on the end of the frame, to the <br>
spinning cylinder in the other end of the frame, and to the other aluminum bracket in the stand in order to<br>
achieve movement along the rails. In the center of the platform, one of the two servo motors is attached to a<br>
spinning disk. This spinning disk is attached to a rotating track that is attached to the arm of the system.<br>
This way, the servo motor is able to move the arm up and down. The disk and rotating track is made of plastic.<br>
The arm consists of an acrylic stand hooked up to aluminum brackets that connects to the spinning track. Underneath<br>
the acrylic stand, we have another servo motor attached to the stand with duck tape. This is due to change.<br>
Other than that, the servo motor has a magnet, which will pick up the parts, attached to it. This way we can<br>
achieve rotation on the subsystem if it is in the wrong orientation. Image of the current Part Placer is shown below.
